          <h2>The introduction to design.</h2>
          <p>Growing up, I found thousands of ways to distract myself from homework.
            I would draw my favorite cartoon characters with the help of reference sheets I found online.
            I researched and downloaded programs that would allow me to create images with my mouse.
            I collected dozens of USBs and external hard drives filled with my favorite pieces of art.
            But as I started applying to colleges, social and familial pressures made me resign myself to a STEM job.
            So I graduated with a biology degree.</p>
          <p>
            I always thought I would become a doctor - or at least a researcher.
            But, I couldn't satisfy the burning curiosity within me.
            I didn't want to sit behind a microscope, writing reports on organisms moving too slowly for the naked eye to see.
            I’ve tutored children and taught piano, and I even worked with patients in a physical therapy clinic.
            I thought I would feel more fulfilled if I could teach and change other lives that way.
            Even then, I knew I needed something more and different.
          </p>
          <p class="space">
            UI/UX is the intersection between the study of humans, technology, and visual design.
            When I first heard about it, I felt like I could finally have a little bit of everything.
            The research behind user design fascinates me.
            It’s amazing how human experiences can guide and define product decisions.
            User experience design attracted me because of its ability to touch lives in a way that photography or petri dishes alone could not.
            Like biology, I can study and design human experiences that affect my surroundings.
            Like art, I could fulfill the creativity that was desperate to burst out of me.
            It is difficult and slow for people to create change through scientific papers or works of art.
            Design would allow me to bring quicker, more tangible change, literally, at the touch of my users' hands.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Why design matters to me.</h2>
          <p>Design is important to me because it permeates every aspect of my life.</p>
          <p class="space">
            Life is designed.
            Everything is designed, from the products I use to the systems that affect my commute to work.
            It humbles me to think that I can contribute to this world by creating an experience other humans can actually use.
            Not only does design affect everything and everyone around me, I can use design to make a difference in the world.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Using design to make a difference.</h2>
          <p>The greatest thing I’d like to do with design is to work on something that can improve a person’s life.
            I want to design something that can influence an existing idea by making it bigger and better.
          </p>
          <p>Tons of social issues can enjoy the digitization of analog processes.
            I want to design an experience that can fast-forward social change in the world.</p>
